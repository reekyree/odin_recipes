    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A perfect weeknight lasagna, that tastes just like home. This lasagna starts with
        a delectible homemade sauce that is incredibly easy to whip up. Along with the
        sauce, the fresh, full-moisture mozzarella brings a whole new level of flavor 
        to an already flavorful dish. </p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Start the sauce about 30 minutes in advance.
            In a large deep saucepan medium heat, saut√© 
            the onion and garlic in 3 tablespoons of 
            olive oil until onions are soft. 
        </li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and brown, stirring frequently. </li>
        <li> Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring until bubbling,
             about 3 minutes. Add water, tomatoes, salt, basil, 
             cayenne pepper, and bay leaf. Stir well. </li>
        <li> Reduce heat to low and simmer slowly, uncovered, 
            for 15 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened. </li>
        <li> Bring a stockpot full of water to a rolling boil and 
            season with salt. Add the lasagna noodles and cook as the package 
            directs, stirring frequently to prevent sticking.
            Drain and toss gently with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.</li>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 350 F and grab a large 3-quart 
            rectangular baking dish.</li>
        <li> Spoon 4 to 6 tablespoons of the sauce or 
            just enough to cover the bottom of the baking dish.</li>
        <li> Top with a single layer of noodles. 
            Spoon about 1/3 of the remaining sauce over the noodles.
            Spoon about 1/2 of the ricotta cheese evenly over the layer of sauce,
            then sprinkle a few tablespoons of Parmesan cheese over that.
            Add about 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li> Repeat with another 1/3 of noodles, another 1/3 of the sauce, 
            the remaining ricotta, another 1/3 of the mozzarella and a few 
            tablespoons of Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li> Finish with the last layer of noodles, 
            the remaining sauce, Parmesan, and mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li> Bake the lasagna, uncovered, for 45 minutes. 
            If the top is browning too fast or the noodles are burning, 
            cover loosely with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li> Remove from oven and let cool 10 minutes before slicing into squares and serving.</li>
    </ol>
